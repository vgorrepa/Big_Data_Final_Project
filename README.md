# Big_Data_Final_Project
This is my final project for a Big Data Certificate course 

Abstract 

Patient feedback on various pharmaceutical drugs in the form of ratings and comments can be utilized for clinical research. Patient drug review data can be obtained by web scraping or web crawling various pharmaceutical online websites.  Such reviews contain a large amount of user sentiment related to a particular condition, which may be useful in the detection of side effects and understanding the efficacy of drugs. The analysis of this subjective data using natural language processing and sentiment analysis can provide powerful insights which in turn could support further research to improve the patient experience. 

 The UCI ML Drug Review dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10-star patient rating system reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. This data was published in a study on sentiment analysis of drug experience over various facets. 
 
This project will attempt to answer some research questions such as the following.
•	Can the patient’s condition be predicted based on the reviews?
•	Can the Drug rating be predicted based on the reviews?
•	Can we determine if a review is positive or neutral or negative?

Sentiment Analysis will be conducted using the Python programming language.Various analytic tools will be utilized to conduct data analysis. Python programming language has powerful libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib which are utilized for high level mathematical functions, data manipulation and analysis. In addition, Python has Scikit-learn which is a Machine Learning library. Python will primarily be used for this project via Jupyter Notebook. Apart from this Microsoft Azure platform will also be used. A GitHub repository will be created, and reports created for this project will be uploaded there.
